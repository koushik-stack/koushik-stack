Hi there! 
I'm Koushik, a remote software engineer and a Bachelor student 

I currently work as a software engineer at @Anthropic, where I help build and improve system level bidder ML models and API  that make Anthropic money . Previously, I was at @pengiun.

I'm passionate about building products at scale—I've launched major features on industry-leading services and apps with 25M+ installs, and automated systems across high-traffic platforms.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I publish article and write newsletters of my daily research in tech.
